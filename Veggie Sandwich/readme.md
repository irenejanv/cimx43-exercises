#Things to do

---

I am going to have the each line of text from the poem fade in, moving upwards as the user scrolls down.

Sandwich moves in from side as you scroll -this is css transition: transform

Each text line needs to be it's own div.
Div class is the same for the divs that will do the same thing.
CSS is a fader.
going to create a "intersectionObserver" need a function
Scrolly uses rootMargin in javascript to define the amount of space at the bottom of the screen before the element fades in

---

threshold:
1 = the whole element has to be within the confines of the viewport  
 before animation fires.
0 = the smallest piece of the element has to be within the confines of the viewport before the animation fires.
.25 = you can adjust how much of the element shows up in the viewport before an animation or something fires.
