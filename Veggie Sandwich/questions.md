#Assignment Questions

What were you trying to accomplish? What was the tutorial or inspiration you tried to work with?<br>
I wanted to accomplish a scrollytelling webpage with the poem where the lines of text come in as you scroll. I used intersection observer to accomplish it.<br>

What was the most frustrating part of working on this exercise? The most rewarding?<br>
It took a while for me to understand the concept of intersection observers and then understand that the actual animation part takes place in CSS. After I got that, then I could understand how to implement the code into my project and how the two were linked. The most rewarding part was when I got the first poem line to fade in. I was soooo excited. <br>
Would you do this exercise again? <br>
Yes, I liked that we go to pick our own things and that it's a project that I can continue to build on. <br>
What would you change if you had another week?<br>
Ideally, I would want the different parts of the sandwich to appear as they are talked about in the poem and then as you scroll the sandwich ingredients come together and squish into a sandwich. This would take a long time, mostly because I would have to redraw all the sandwich parts in illustrator. And then I'm not sure how I would implement the scrolling and if it would even look good with all the separate drawn sandwich pieces coming together, but this is what I ideally would want to do.
