  <h1>Veggie Sandwich</h1>
  <body>
    <p>
      There once was a veggie sandwich <br />
      Who was told his whole life, <br />
      He wouldn’t amount to much. <br />

      “You’re full of veggies!” they said. <br />

      “No meat!” <br />
      <br />
      Defined by what he was missing— <br />
      <br />
      Instant defeat. <br />
      <br />
      “Don’t listen to them,” the cucumber said. <br />
      “Your ingredients are intentional between the bread.” <br />
      <br />
      A thick creamy tzitziki on a Kaiser roll<br />
      Topped with vegan tendies, breaded and crisp! <br />
      Leaving the eater nothing to miss! <br />
      <br />
      Next a layer of homemade cilantro mayo <br />
      Then, cucumber and a slice of tomato… <br />
      <br />
      Topped off with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. <br />
      Cilantro mayo again, a big squeeze!<br />
      <br />
      The bread on top, keeps everything stacked tight. <br />
      Veggie sandwich, a real delight.<br />
      Despite the naysayers, he’s the best of his kind. <br />
      We’ll have him again, one more time! <br />
