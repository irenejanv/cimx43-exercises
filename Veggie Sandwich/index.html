      There once was a veggie sandwich, <br />
      Who was told his whole life, <br />
      He wouldn’t amount to much. <br />

      <p class="italics"> "You're full of veggies!" they said.</p>

      “No meat!” <br />
      <br />
      Defined by what he was missing— <br />
      <br />
      <p class="defeat">Instant defeat.</p>
      <br />
      “Don’t listen to them,” the cucumber said. <br />
      <p class="intentional">“Your ingredients are intentional between the bread.”</p>
      <br />
      A thick creamy <span style="color: #5af7ae;">tzatziki</span> on a <span style="color: #e9cfbc">Kaiser roll</span
    ><br />
      Topped with <span style="color: #f5a046">vegan tendies</span
    >, breaded and crisp! <br />
      Leaving the eater nothing to miss! <br />
      <br />
      Next a layer of homemade <span style="color: #4ced17">cilantro mayo </span> <br />
      Then, <span style="color: #5af7ae;">cucumber</span> and a slice of <span style="color: #f75a5a">tomato</span>… <br />
      <br />
      Topped off with <span style="color: #4ced17;">arugula</span> and <span style="color: #f5e295;">shaved parmesan cheese.</span> <br />
      <p class="cilmayo">Cilantro mayo again, a big squeeze!</p>
      <br />
      The <span style="color: #e9cfbc">bread</span
    > on top, keeps everything stacked tight. <br />
      Veggie sandwich, a real <span style="color: #5af7ae;">d</span><span style="color: rgb(180, 138, 220)">e</span><span style="color: #4ced17;">l</span><span style="color: #e9cfbc;">i</span><span style="color: #f75a5a;">g</span><span style="color: #f7ea5a">h</span><span style="color: #5af7ae;">t</span>.<br />
      Despite the naysayers, he’s the best of his kind. <br />
      <p class="moretime">We’ll have him again, one more time!</p>
